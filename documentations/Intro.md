## Runner
Runner is a web application where users can sign up and post the DSA questions they've solved. For example, if you solved 3 questions today, you would upload the links to those questions, describe the approach you used, and explain why some of your approaches failed while others worked.

It’s important to keep a record of all the questions you've solved, along with your approaches. The platform will also feature a live leaderboard, ranking users based on different metrics like the number of questions solved in a day, problem difficulty, consistency (streaks), and more.

The goal of this project is to foster a competitive coding environment in our college and promote healthy competition.
