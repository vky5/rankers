## Runner
Runner is a web application where users can sign up and 
post the DSA questions they've solved. 
For example, if you solved 3 questions today, 
you would upload the links to those questions, describe the 
approach you used, and explain why some of your approaches 
failed while others worked.

Itâ€™s important to keep a record of all the questions you've solved, 
along with your approaches. The platform will also feature a live leaderboard, 
ranking users based on different metrics like the number of questions solved in 
a day, problem difficulty, consistency (streaks), and more.

The goal of this project is to foster a competitive coding environment 
in our college and promote healthy competition.
